# Machine_Learning_Experimentation
A compilation of Machine learning algorithms, experimenting with different parameters
The data set used here is from UCI machine learning repository: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

I built 3 classification models in Python, and experimented by tuning different parameterers is each. In the end all models are ranked based on accuracy using k-fold validation

1. Support Vector Machine - 
Experimented with linear, Sigmoid and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernels
2. Decision Tree
Experimented with different depths of decision tree
3. Boosting with Decision Tree - Adaboost
Experimented with different depths of decision tree
